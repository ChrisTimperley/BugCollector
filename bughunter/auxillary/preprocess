# Used by the host to issue a pre-process request, which is then forwarded onto
# the appropriate Docker instance, via this script. The pre-processed files,
# together with all other compilation artefacts, are left in the repository
# directory. It is the responsibility of the host to fetch the particular
# pre-processed in which it is interested in, and not that of this script.

# USAGE:
# ./preprocess [repository-location] [dockerfile-location]

# Mount the repository at /repository, and the pre-processing script at
